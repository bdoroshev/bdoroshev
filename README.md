✅ I’m a passionate Front End / Shopify Developer since 2016. If you need a professional, modern, and responsive Shopify / HTML website – you are in the right place. I work fast and clearly, and I speak and write English fluently, so our communication will be smooth and clear.

• Care about relationships. “Clients for life” and “same boat” approach <br />
• Close collaboration - the more you're involved the better the result is <br />
• Deliver 101% results with Agile <br />
• Great at remote work with various time zones <br />
• Fluent in English and learn skills extremely fast <br />
